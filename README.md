# Collection of Demo Projects for learning GraphQl

Some of these are tutorials found online, and some are venturing out on my own to look at different things.

## odyssey-intro-typescript
This is the code from this [tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/intro-typescript)

## odyssey-intro-hotchocolate
This is the code from this [tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/intro-hotchocolate)

There are 2 projects in this solution that produce the same GraphQL Api in 2 different manners.

1. Odyssey.MusicMatcher is the tutorial project and uses the Attribute method of [Hot Chocolate](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate/v13) to create the schema.
2. Odyssey.MusicMatcher.SDL is  copy of that project, but uses a schema first approach.
